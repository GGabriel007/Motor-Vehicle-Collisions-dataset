# Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-dataset
Our analysis is centered around the Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset sourced from NYC Open Data, focusing specifically on incidents within New York City. The Data base was created in MySQL. By selecting relevant columns like Unique ID, Collision ID, Crash Date, and others, we aim to explore the detailed aspects of police-reported motor vehicle collisions across the city. With a vast dataset, our analysis can potentially uncover insights across various dimensions of collision events. 
Logic Design.
